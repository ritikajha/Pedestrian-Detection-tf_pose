# Pedestrian-Detection-using-tf_pose
A approach to detect the pedestrians using tensorflow pose, in order to assist fully or semi automatic driving systems. Further working to use the key-points to classify attentive and non attentive pedestrians on road.

Here we have tf_pose to detect pedestrians in videos , tf_pose returns the key-points that are the key body parts position of a person using the heat map of a body when detected.
Following is some example of pose detection in images and body heat maps.

Further the same model is used to detect multiple people together in a video.Following I have shown some of the frames of resultant videos.

I will soon add some code in which, These key-points can will be used to detect the pose and detect whether they are attentive on road or not. The system will further alert the driver or the driving system.
